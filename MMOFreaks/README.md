# MMOFreaks

Welcome to MMOFreaks! This gem allows you to create a basic build setup for your favorite characters. For future expansion, I would like to include artifacts and actual gear stats and pictures. In order to run this application, enter shotgun in your terminal and create your own accounts. Accounts require a username, email, and password in order to be successfully inputed. I look forward to all contributions! If you would like to get in contact with me regarding this application and future advancements, please reach out at:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'MMOFreaks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install MMOFreaks

## Usage

This application initiates using shotgun to load its server and store information into the database. Use this application as a rough guide to store your character loadouts. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
